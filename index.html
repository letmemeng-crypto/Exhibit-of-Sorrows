        <h1>Exhibit of Sorrows: Can You Survive the Circus Museum?</h1>

        <p>Welcome to <strong>Exhibit of Sorrows</strong>, a spine-chilling point-and-click horror game that plunges you into the depths of a twisted circus museum. This atmospheric horror experience challenges you to navigate through macabre exhibits, solve disturbing puzzles, and interact with haunting circus dolls—all while trying not to anger the sinister clown that lurks in the shadows.</p>

        <p>In this unsettling adventure, every click matters. The game masterfully blends psychological horror with puzzle-solving mechanics, creating an experience that will keep you on edge from start to finish. As you explore the eerie museum, you'll uncover dark secrets and face choices that could mean the difference between escape and eternal entrapment.</p>

        <h2>Meet the Dolls in Exhibit of Sorrows</h2>

        <p>The circus dolls are the heart of this horror experience. Each doll has its own personality, backstory, and role in the museum's twisted narrative:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Ringmaster Doll:</strong> Once the proud leader of the circus, now a hollow shell with secrets to share</li>
            <li><strong>The Acrobat Twins:</strong> Forever frozen mid-performance, their painted smiles hiding tragic tales</li>
            <li><strong>The Fortune Teller:</strong> Her crystal ball may reveal your fate—if you dare to look</li>
            <li><strong>The Clown:</strong> The most dangerous of all. Keep him happy, or face the consequences</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Each interaction with these dolls reveals fragments of the museum's dark history and provides clues essential to your escape. But be warned: some dolls are more helpful than others, and trust is a luxury you can't afford.</p>
